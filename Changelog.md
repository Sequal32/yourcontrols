### New issues

- B-events/variables: This is a new system introduced by Asobo with Sim Update 5. All switches and levers now using "B:" no longer visually move but any associated "A:" or "L:" secondary vars will still sync, causing proper effect. This is because "B:" is not settable through SimConnect. Asobo currently shows no intent on fixing this.
- Touchscreen interaction on 3rd-party avionics packages currently does not sync. This is a 3rd-party WASM limitation. Full support for such packages may or may not be possible.
- JustFlight PA-28 Bundle: Avionics power trouble may occur during cold start if GPS type on tablet are not the same for all connected. Each person should cycle type before powering.
- Milviz C310R: Some actions on tablet only sync once everyone connected has tablet visible.
- FlyByWire current fuel state unsyncable.
